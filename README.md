## Introduction

### Background
The data analysed by this programme is the "Iris Flower Data Set". R.A. Fisher collated and presented the data set in 1936 in his paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems". In this paper he studied the use of linear combinations of multiple characterising features of a species to discriminate it from related species. Fisher studied three related species of iris flowers in this paper:
* Iris setosa
* Iris versicolor
* Iris virginica

Fifty samples of each species was analysed, with the data for Iris setosa and Iris versicolor having been provided by his then-colleague, Botanist Edgar Anderson, from a study of a single colony.

Fisher studied four characteristics of each species:
* Petal Length
* Petal Width
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width


### Literature Review and Interesting Previous Analyses

### Issues and Inconsistencies with Dataset
It is noted that there are three inconsistencies between the dataset sourced from ****LINK**** and the dataset presented by Fisher ****LINK****:

1. 35th sample: the fourth feature is given as "0.1" where Fisher had originally given "0.2".
2. 38th sample: the second feature is given as "3.1" where Fisher had originally given "3.6".
3. 38th sample: the third feature is given as "1.5" where Fisher had originally given "1.4".

These three errors have an effect on the analysis of the dataset as follows:
